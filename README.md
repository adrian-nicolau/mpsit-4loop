## Project Description
Our goal is to write an anonymous Twitter-like app with location-awareness.
That is, a simple app which allows users to post "thoughts" that are only
visible to other users within, let's say, 50 meters. Users are anonymous, at
login they will receive an unique ID and this ID will be used throughout the app
for thoughts posting or discovery. The web frontend and Android app will be
comprised of two views, one for the user profile and one for the map discovery.
Both will exercise location APIs.

Catchphrase: *keeping you in the **loop**!*
